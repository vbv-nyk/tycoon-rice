Dear Ricers,<br/>
The following is a full customisable idle tycoon. <br/>
Define your garden (Static image)<br/>
Define the land on your garden <br/>
Place sprites on your garden (Touch grass?)<br/>
Specify what happens to your sprites over time (Stare at your monitor)<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

get creative,<br/>
see you soon,<br/>
