Dear Ricers,<br/>
The following is a full customisable idle tycoon. <br/>
Define your garden (Static image)<br/>
Define the land on your garden <br/>
Place sprites on your garden (Touch grass?)<br/>
Specify what happens to your sprites over time (Stare at your monitor)<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

thank you, <br/>
get creative,<br/>
see you soon,<br/>

At the heart we have a config file. This defines what our garden, land and sprites will look like. The only other variable will be the age of the tycoon. 
The idea is that the user places the sprites on the land and then specifies the age.
The age keeps updating and we rerender the wallpaper.
that's it for now.
