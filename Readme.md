We have a Garden.
Garden has a background by default. This is a static image.
Garden will contain Areas.
Areas will have their own background. And may have stages.

You can place plants on areas.
Plants have growth, growth will have stages which will define their appearence over time.

Basically I will have a Garden object
Garden = {

}

Garden will contain areas

Garden = {
    Areas = {

    }
}

Areas will contain sprite(s) that will grow over time.
